Full service worker starter 
===========================

> More realistic service worker starter

Check here: 

## Overview

This is some sort of a second part of my simple [sw-starter](https://github.com/YerkoPalma/sw-starter). The main differences here are:

* No `localStorage`, instead [`Dexie.js`](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js) is used
* The service-worker is now generated with [`sw-precache`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-precache)
* The _offline first_ strategy is a bit improved
